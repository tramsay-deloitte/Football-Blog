    "## Will a Wide Receiver be good in the NFL?\n",
    "\n",
    "I have many thoughts about how wide receivers can be projected coming out of college into the NFL.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Patriots fan, I have seen many receivers drafted in the first or second round and have them get cut only a few years later. Although I don't expect any pity given the Super Bowls I remember so fondly, I also remember our last great drafted receiver being a quarterback from Kent State in the 7th round named Julian Edelman, and our more recent pretty good receiver being a Quarterback from NC State named Jakobi Meyers. Why did Bill have an easier time finding QBs converting to WRs than people that played WR their whole lives and are 99th percentile athletes? Blows my mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "We look back at the Nkeal Harry draft and wince at the fact that nearly every other first round pick was a hit AND some of the best receivers in the league were taken after him. DK Metcalf, AJ Brown, Deebo Samuel, Terry McLaurin... c'mon man. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the fact that I feel it can't be THAT hard, I will be pooling together public data about these draft prospects and finding if data and relatively simple modeling strategy can predict whether a guy is going to be good before he's going to be good.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist and not a scout that's watching an athlete from the stands at the Senior Bowl, during their college season, or following their career closely in the NFL, I need to find some proxies to determine what gives a WR a hand up in the draft process and what determines success in the NFL.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step is to determine a proxy for success in the NFL. Although not a perfect measurement, my metric will be APY as a % of Cap at Signing from [Over The Cap](https://overthecap.com/). Although we still need for the inflation of the WR market, this metric helps control for the changing salary cap while also representing how much a team is willing to invest in a player. We will specifically be looking at every players second contract to represent how well the prospect performed on their rookie deal to earn that second contract. Obviously players are overpaid or take pay cuts to play on a good team, we can figure that out later."
